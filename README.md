### Problem Statement

**Objective:** To build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, **Power BI Business Insights 360**, that provides detailed insights into various business aspects, including financial performance, supply chain efficiency, marketing effectiveness, and executive-level overview. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and metrics in a single, user-friendly platform. The dashboard should be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific data points based on time periods, regions, markets, customers, segments, and categories.

### Steps to Create the Power BI Dashboard

#### 1. **Define Business Requirements**
   - **Identify Key Stakeholders:** Consult with finance, supply chain, marketing, and executive teams to understand their specific needs.
   - **List KPIs and Metrics:** Determine which KPIs (e.g., net sales, GM%, net profit%, forecast accuracy) are most critical for each view (financial, supply chain, marketing, executive).
   - **Establish Filtering Needs:** Define the filtering options (yearly, quarterly, region, market, customer, etc.) required to make the dashboard interactive.

#### 2. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - **Data Sources:** Identify and gather data from relevant sources such as ERP systems, CRM systems, marketing databases, and other financial tools.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Use tools like Power Query to clean and transform the raw data into a usable format. Handle missing values, duplicates, and data types.
   - **Data Modeling:** Create relationships between different data tables, ensuring that they are properly linked to facilitate accurate reporting and analysis.

#### 3. **Design the Data Model**
   - **Create Fact Tables:** Develop fact tables to store quantitative data, such as sales, profits, and error rates.
   - **Create Dimension Tables:** Develop dimension tables to store descriptive data, such as product details, customer information, time periods, and regional data.
   - **Establish Relationships:** Define relationships between fact and dimension tables using primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and facilitate complex queries.

#### 4. **Build Visuals for Each View**
   - **Financial View:**
     - Use line charts for net sales performance over time.
     - Create bar charts for profit and loss statements.
     - Use KPI cards for net sales, GM%, and net profit%.
     - Utilize bar or column charts for top/bottom regions and segments by net sales.
   - **Supply Chain View:**
     - Line charts for forecast accuracy and net error trends.
     - KPI cards for forecast accuracy %, net error, and absolute error.
     - Tables or matrix visuals for key metrics by product and customer.
   - **Marketing View:**
     - Use bar charts or treemaps to represent product performance and region/market/customer performance.
     - Matrix or scatter plots for performance matrix and unit economics.
   - **Executive View:**
     - Use a combination of KPI cards for high-level KPIs.
     - Line charts for yearly trends (revenue, GM%, net profit).
     - Bar charts for revenue by division and channel.
     - Tables or pie charts for top 5 customers by revenue and product.

#### 5. **Add Interactivity and Filters**
   - **Slicers:** Implement slicers for filtering data by time periods (yearly, quarterly), regions, markets, customers, and segments.
   - **Drill-through Options:** Enable drill-through functionality to allow users to click on data points and get more detailed information.
   - **Bookmarks and Buttons:** Use bookmarks and buttons to switch between different views and reports, making the dashboard more interactive.

#### 6. **Design and Layout**
   - **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent color scheme, fonts, and layout across all views for a professional look.
   - **Titles and Labels:** Ensure all charts and visuals have clear titles, labels, and legends to enhance readability.
   - **Tooltips:** Add tooltips to provide additional information when hovering over data points.

#### 7. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Check Data Accuracy:** Validate that all visuals and KPIs reflect the correct data.
   - **Test Filters:** Ensure all slicers and drill-through options are functioning correctly.
   - **User Feedback:** Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

#### 8. **Deployment**
   - **Publish Dashboard:** Publish the Power BI report to the Power BI service.
   - **Set Permissions:** Configure user access permissions based on roles (e.g., financial team, marketing team, executives).
   - **Schedule Data Refresh:** Set up automatic data refresh schedules to ensure the dashboard always displays up-to-date information.

#### 9. **Training and Documentation**
   - **User Training:** Provide training sessions for end-users to help them understand how to use the dashboard effectively.
   - **Documentation:** Create user manuals or guides detailing how to navigate the dashboard, interpret the visuals, and use filters.

#### 10. **Ongoing Maintenance and Improvements**
   - **Monitor Performance:** Regularly review dashboard performance and loading times. Optimize if necessary.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop for users to suggest improvements or report issues.
   - **Update as Needed:** Periodically update the dashboard to include new metrics or views as business needs evolve.
